# Summary

This project is based on Chapter 12 of "[Modern JavaScript The Complete Course - Build +10 Projects](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-the-complete-course-build-10-projects/)" by [Juan Pablo De la torre Valdez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanpablodelatorre/). Chapter 12 is a very simple Weekly Budget app made with jQuery 3.3.1 and Popper.js

The HTML and CSS for this project was provided already pre-written and ready-made via the Udemy course materials, and I wrote the JavaScript as a codealong while taking the course.

### Functionality

Using this app, one can add or create a budget for the week and track spending. Once we've spent half, the remaining budget appears in yellow. Upon having spent three-quarters of the budget, the remaining portion then appears in red.
